This whimsical web page was developed in response to this prompt in Section 1.2.5 of the 'W3Cx JavaScript Introduction' course I am taking on edX:

* Try to make a simple home page and add some interactivity to it, adapting the examples provided in the course (change the HTML content by clicking on a button, change the CSS style of some parts of the document).

It will be shared there via CodePen '[My(?) Home Page]('My(?) Home Page')'.
